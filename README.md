## Description
### HELP DESK APP 
![](https://github.com/Nmuta/helpdesk/blob/open_vs_closed/public/images/logo.png)

This app contains 3 branches.  Your mission is to `git checkout` each branch, one at a time, read the README, and fix each branches problems that are described in the README.  

As you fix each bug, `git add, commit` your work
(use concise, clear commit messages that communicate what you fixed).

<br>
<br>
### ❗️ DO THE BRANCHES IN THIS ORDER: 

1. OPEN VS. CLOSED
2. ITERATION
3. BROKEN 


You DO NOT have to fix the same problem twice. Read the instructions for each branch and ONLY  work on what the README tells you for each branch.
